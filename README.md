# ExpressFormExample
Very basic expressjs form posting example for my CSCI115 course

This code is **not** secure, and should only be used while being montiored, and not on any production environment.

To run this code, install nodejs (any version 8+)
then install npm (if it didnt come with nodejs (normally on ubuntu you need to use sudo apt install npm))

Then use "npm i" in the terminal
then finally, launch the site with "node ./index.js" in the terminal

If this doesn't make sense to you, I'll keep the demo.ajnicoloff.me site up for about a week to play around with :)
